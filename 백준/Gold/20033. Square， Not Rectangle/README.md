### 문제 설명

<p>A histogram is a polygon made by aligning $N$ adjacent rectangles that share a common base line. Each rectangle is called a bar. The $i$-th bar from the left has width 1 and height $H_i$.</p>

<p>Your goal is to find the area of the largest rectangle contained in the given histogram, such that one of the sides is parallel to the base line.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Figure 1. The histogram given in the example, with the largest rectangle shown on the right.</em></p>

<p>Actually, no, you have to find the largest <strong>square</strong>. Since the area of a square is determined by its side length, you are required to output the <strong>side length</strong> instead of the area.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>On the first line, a single integer $N$ is given, where $1 \le N \leq 300\,000$.</p>

<p>On the next line, $N$ space-separated integers $H_1, H_2, \cdots, H_N$, are given. $H_i$ $(1 \le H_i \le 10^9)$ is the height of the $i$-th bar. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the side length of the largest square in the histogram, such that one of the sides is parallel to the base line.</p>
